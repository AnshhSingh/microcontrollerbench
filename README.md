# microcontrollerbench
- Benchmarking microcontrollers and embedded devices has always been a challenge due to limited memory and cpu 
- This code aims to benchmark all main functions of arduino board such as calculation speeds,assembly instruction time, memory fetch latency,general pin input output latency etc and provide a final score to determine performance
